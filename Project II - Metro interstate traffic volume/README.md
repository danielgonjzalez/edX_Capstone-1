# edX_Capstone
GitHub for the course "Data Science: Capstone" (PH125.9x) by edX and HarvardX

This project was the second assignment of the 'Data Science: Capstone' course (PH125.9x), offered by HarvardX. The goal was to choose and use any publicly available dataset to apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression and to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from the analysis. The dataset chosen is about the traffic volume at an American interstate.
