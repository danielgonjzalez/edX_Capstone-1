# edX_Capstone
GitHub for the course "Data Science: Capstone" (PH125.9x) by edX and HarvardX

The goal of the first project was to predict movie ratings using a large dataset defined by the course.

The aim of the second project was to choose and use a publicly available dataset to apply machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression and to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from the analysis. The dataset 
choosen is about the traffic volume at an American interstate.
